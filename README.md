# 🧠 MIT EECS in One Year – My Self-Learning Journey
> Start Date: July 1, 2025
> 
> **End Date:** July 1, 2026
> 
> **Mission:** To master the core of MIT's Electrical Engineering & Computer Science curriculum within one year, learning rigorously and building deep technical intuition.
> 
> **Why:** To build world-class technical depth and earn the mental discipline of an MIT engineer.
> 
> **Inspired by:** [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/), missing.csail.mit.edu, and trailblazers like Nand2Tetris, George Hotz, and OpenAI engineers.

### Who I Am

Hi there! I’m **Karthik Murali M**, a B.S. Data Science & Applications student at **IIT Madras** (2024–2028).

I’m deeply interested in **AI, systems, compilers, product engineering, quantitative finance**, and becoming a **modern polymath**.

This challenge is my way of pushing beyond conventional education — I want to **master CS like an MIT EECS grad**, even without enrolling at MIT.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- To complement my **IITM DS degree** with solid CS theory and engineering depth
- To **understand the "deep code" behind everything** — from memory and circuits to models and algorithms
- To build world-class foundations in CS, math, and EE
- To push my limits intellectually, creatively, and spiritually
- To become the kind of person who can build things that matter

### 📚 What I’ll Be Studying

| Semester | Focus Areas |
| --- | --- |
| Semester 1 | Programming, Discrete Math, Algorithms, Circuits |
| Semester 2 | Systems, OS, Linear Algebra, ML, Python Projects |
| Semester 3 | Compilers, Databases, Networking, Control Systems |
| Semester 4 | Advanced ML, AI, Ethics, Capstone Projects |

✅ All based on the **MIT EECS Syllabus**

🎓 In sync with my IITM DS curriculum

🛠️ GitHub, Python, Anki, Obsidian, ChatGPT as daily tools

### 🧠 My Learning Principles

- **"Don’t memorize — understand."**
- **"Build something every month."**
- **"Finish what you start."**
- **"Keep things simple, but deep."**
- **"Write, teach, reflect."**
- **"Progress > Perfection."**

### ⚒️ Tools I Use

- 🧠 **Notion** – This dashboard & progress logs
- 🐍 **Python** – Primary programming language
- ⚙️ **VSCode / Jupyter** – Practice + projects
- 🐙 **GitHub** – All code and writeups (public)
- 💾 **Anki** – Flashcards for math and theory
- 💬 **ChatGPT** – Mentor, debugger, tutor
- ⌨️ **Obsidian** – Zettelkasten-style permanent notes
